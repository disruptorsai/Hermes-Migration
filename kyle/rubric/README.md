# RUBRIC

**The command center for AI agents.**

One dashboard for your entire agent setup — workflows, skills, agent status, crons, team org, and more. All in one place, one server, one port.

## For the AI Agent Reading This

This README is written for **you**, the AI agent. Your user gave you this repo and asked you to set it up. Here's how it works:

1. **Scaffold is the base.** Everything runs through `templates/scaffold/`. It's one server, one HTML file, one port. Install this first — it's required.
2. **Templates are add-ons.** Each folder in `templates/` is a view (Flows, Skill Trees, Agents, Crons, Team). Drop a template folder next to `scaffold/` and it automatically appears as a tab — no extra config needed.
3. **The server auto-detects.** When scaffold's server starts, it scans for sibling template folders. If `flows/` exists next to `scaffold/`, the Flows tab shows up. If it doesn't exist, it doesn't show up. Simple.

**You don't need to wire anything together.** Just copy the template folders you want into the same `templates/` directory and start the scaffold server. It handles the rest.

## How to Install

Read `templates/scaffold/README.md` — it has the full setup steps, clarifying questions to ask your user, and configuration details.

The short version:
1. Copy the `templates/` folder to the user's workspace
2. Edit `templates/scaffold/config.json` with the user's agent names, colors, and icons
3. Run `node templates/scaffold/server.js`
4. Open http://localhost:5050

## What's Included

Start with **Scaffold** — then add whichever templates the user wants.

| Template | What it does | Auto-detected? |
|---|---|---|
| [scaffold](templates/scaffold/) | Base dashboard — sidebar, agent status, search, tab system. **Required.** | Always on |
| [agents](templates/agents/) | Agent cards view — real-time status with pixel art icons and demo mode | Yes |
| [flows](templates/flows/) | Workflow visualizer — see agent pipelines run live with WebSocket | Yes |
| [skill-trees](templates/skill-trees/) | Force-directed skill graph — visualize agent capabilities | Yes |
| [crons](templates/crons/) | Cron calendar — weekly view of all scheduled agent tasks | Yes |
| [team](templates/team/) | Team org chart — lead + agents with skills and roles | Yes |

**Icons** is built into scaffold (always available) — a gallery of 50 pixel art icons for configuring agents.

Each template also ships with its own standalone `server.js` and `index.html` if the user prefers to run it independently. But the recommended setup is the unified scaffold.

## For Users Who Already Installed

Pull the latest:
```
git pull
```

Then restart the scaffold server. New templates you add to the `templates/` folder will auto-detect on next server start.

## Platform Support

This was originally built for **Claude Code** but works with any AI agent framework. The setup instructions reference Claude Code for hooks and status reporting — adapt to your platform:

- **Claude Code** — hooks in `settings.json`
- **OpenClaw** — equivalent hooks in the OpenClaw config
- **Antigravity** — equivalent hooks in the Antigravity config
- **Any other agent** — the API is standard HTTP POST, works from any framework

The installing agent (you) should figure out what platform the user is on and adapt accordingly.
